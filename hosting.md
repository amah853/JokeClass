# Want to Suggest?  

Sure, but...

## Prerequiste
Suggestions are only accepted through the exclusive "Sneak Peaks" Google Classroom, reserved for only the **elite joke class members**.  

## How Do I Join?
It's simple! We'll drop the Google Classroom code randomly, and this disappears within 20 minutes, sometimes 30. This ensures only the most loyal members-those that see my posts in the first 20 minutes-can join. 

Oh, and by the way: **You can't screenshot the code** and share it around. The code will be reset 20-30 minutes after it has been posted keep the class exclusive.
