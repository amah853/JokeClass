## Grading FAQ

---

**How was my grade determined?**
Bcuz we felt like it lol. 

**All of my assignments say 134891/100, how do I have a 0.01% average in the class?**
Well its sorta weird but if one of the assignments is too insane of a grade (e.g. 1004892859248593495839548/100) then it just sorta breaks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**When I joined the class there was already some assignments posted. How do I change it from a missing?**
Good news and bad news. Bad news: you can't. Good news: Anything posted before you join will NOT affect your grade. (not like it matters anyway lol)

**I was bored and I decided to click this link. What should I do with my life?**
Correction: What should I do ~~with my~~ *to get a* life?
