### **Important Guidelines**

#### 1. Assignment Rules

- **Late to the party?** Don't worry—you aren't responsible for assignments that were posted before you joined. 

- **Deadlines matter!** Most assignments lock once they're due. If the assignment is locked, you won't be able to submit a response. 

#### 2. Invite Your Friends! 

The more, the merrier. Let's grow this amazing community! 

**Class Code:** `2uq63v4`

**Class Invite Link:** https://jokeclass.ahmad-mahrous.com/


#### 3. Assignment Schedule

- **New assignments are posted daily at 9:00 AM sharp.** (The assignments are scheduled, so sometimes google classroom posts them a minute or two late.)

- **All assignments are due by 11:59 PM the same day.** (Some summatives have an exception but most of time assignment are due at 11:59pm.)

Just check in every day so that you don't miss out! 

#### 4. Communication

- **Contact me:** Use the Private Comments section on assignments or email me (email perferred). 

- **Quick replies:** I check my email very consistantly. You are more likely to get a response this way.


#### 5. Grading 

- I take grading seriously.kind of. Joke Class grading is all about having fun, so don't stress! Our current class average is approximately **108,394/100**—because you're all amazing.

- **Assignments:**  

 - **Formatives** are due daily.  

 - **Summatives**? They're posted randomly. Keep your eye out for them!

- Once you submit an assignment, your work is locked, and you can't edit it. [(see "1. Assignment Rules")](https://jokeclass.ahmad-mahrous.com/syllabus#1-assignment-rules)

### **Community Expectations**

Joke Class is more than a class—it's a **community**, and a joke. Our goal is to lighten each others day and bring some *jazz* to our normal routine. The below expectations are community wide, and are expected of every person, *including teachers*. 

- **Be kind.** Treat others respectfully, even if you have had run-ins with them before. Everyone gets a clean slate.

- **Engage!** Comment on assignments, respond to your classmate's posts and say hello to new comers. A simple "Welcome!" can go a long way. 

- **Report issues** If you see an inappropriate response, let me know. I'll take care of it and the user will be muted.

Swearing: Absolutely no swearing, except light words such as "heck". Don't say anything off color or inappropriate.

### **Cool Features**

- Once you have submitted a *formative* assignment, a "See Classmate Answers" button will appear. 

 - You can see other responses and even comment on them! 

 - Remember: Comments should be positive.
